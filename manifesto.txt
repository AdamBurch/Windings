My name is Adam David Burch, and I make games.

I make games because I know that 
1) I've been playing games my whole life 
More importantly,
2) I've been /making/ games my whole life
despite this,
3) my knowledge of games is pathetic,
and lastly,
4) my games are awesome, and worth making.

I'VE BEEN PLAYING GAMES MY WHOLE LIFE

Anywhere there is shit to do, and shit that can be done about it, there is a game.

By this logic, damn near everything's a game!

And I would agree with that. The to-clever computer scientist in me couldn't help but agree that damn near everything IS-A game. 

And when everything's a game, how can I stop playing?

I went to high school.

Learn / Get Good Grades - 

I'VE BEEN /MAKING/ GAMES MY WHOLE LIFE

Me and my friends used to try to eat Corn Nuts(tm) after throwing them into the air.

Eat, Show off - Shit to do
Throwing, eating, diving, tackling, etc. - Shit that can be done about it

When on tile floors, I would invent rules limiting my movement (stay on like squares, chess-piece movement only, etc)

Desire to play - Shit to do
Movement - Shit that can be done about it

On long car rides, my siblings and I

MY GAMES ARE AWESOME, AND WORTH MAKING

This is a tautology. All games are awesome, and if I want to do something, then it's worth doing.

My name is Adam David Burch, and this is my manifesto.
