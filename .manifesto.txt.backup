My name is Adam David Burch, and I make games.

I make games because I know that 
1) I've been playing games my whole life 
More importantly,
2) my knowledge of games is pathetic,
and lastly,
3) my games are awesome, and worth making.

I'VE BEEN PLAYING GAMES MY WHOLE LIFE

Anywhere there is shit to do, and shit that can be done about it, there is a game.

By this logic, damn near everything's a game!

The to-clever computer scientist in me couldn't help but agree that damn near everything IS-A game. 

And when everything's a game, how can I stop playing?

I went to high school.

Get good grades - Shit to do
Schoolwork - Shit that can be done about it

My friends and I used to eat Corn Nuts(tm) after throwing them into the air.

Eat, Show off - Shit to do
Throwing, eating, diving, tackling, etc. - Shit that can be done about it

When on tile floors, I would impose rules limiting my movement (stay on like squares, chess-piece movement only, etc)

Desire to play - Shit to do
Movement - Shit that can be done about it

Meditation

Meditate - Shit to do
Meditate - Shit that can be done about it

MY KNOWLEDGE OF GAMES IS PATHETIC

Let's look at our edge cases (the first and latter ones, respectively).

I went to high school.

Get good grades - Shit to do
Schoolwork - Shit that can be done about it

Isn't school supposed to be about...learning? Why has the signifier (grades) taken over for the signified (learnins)? 

Meditation

Meditation - Shit to do
Meditate - Shit that can be done about it

It is only by abandoning our conception of meditation as a game that we can meditate.

Each of these things IS-A game. However, they're also NOT GAME.

Everything that's NOT GAME IS-A game. It's just not supposed to be played. Playing something that's NOT GAME as a game can be smart, but it can also be stupid. The thing is simply NOT GAME.

We now know the set of all things that are NOT GAME - Everything that IS-A game, but is not meant to be played.

We now know the set of all things that are GAME - Everything that IS-A game, and IS meant to be played. 



MY GAMES ARE AWESOME, AND WORTH MAKING

This is a tautology. All games are awesome (exploring the possibility space for a game is THE BEST), and if I want to do something, then it's worth doing.

My name is Adam David Burch, and this is my manifesto.
